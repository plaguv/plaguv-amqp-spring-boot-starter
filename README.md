## 📦 Messaging AMQP Spring Boot Starter

A standardized, opinionated messaging framework for RabbitMQ, designed for internal event-driven communication in Spring Boot applications.

This starter provides:
- Elimination of repetitive RabbitMQ setup
- Enforced domain consistency, type safety, and naming conventions across services
- A plug-and-play experience that is fully extensible

All components are exposed via interfaces, and the starter is fully autoconfigured using Spring Boot’s ``@AutoConfiguration``.

## ⚙️ Configuration

At minimum, each application must define its central exchange and central application, which act as namespaces.

````yaml
amqp:
  central-exchange: central
  central-application: starter # or ${spring.application.name}
````

Further details for configurations are available [here](.docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
